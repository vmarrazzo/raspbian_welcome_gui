# raspbian welcome gui

As the title suggests this application was designed and developed for Raspberry Pi environment but it is not excluded application in other environment where Python 2.x shell is available.

I have developed this application for two reasons :

- simplify the startup of (few) frequently used application on Raspberry Pi just after boot and used until next reboot
- cannot ensure the availability of keyboard connected to Raspberry Pi ( e.g. lazy man on sofa :-) )
